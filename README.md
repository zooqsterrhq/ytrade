# Y Trade
Y Trade is a gamified learning platform for youth interested in trading. 

Users will complete a short survey which will rank them on one of three learning streams: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. The three learning streams will have different content for learning pathways, respective to the specific streams. 

The app will have the following learning modules: 
1. Stock market/stock trading knowledge (reading charts, S/L + T/P, etc.)
2. Crypto/Blockchain
3. Financial knowledge for stock trading (risk management and more) 
4. Trading mindset (trader tips which ensure most gains and least losses)
5. Mentorship from stock traders. 
6. .# ADD MORE MODULES WHEN THEY COME TO MIND 

Users accumulate points through progressing on learning paths on the app, which can be put towards in-app purchases.

# Plan for Y Trade (this plan will definitely change over time, but this is the first overall plan)
1. Create the app
2. Start getting traction on the app through digital marketing, SEO etc.
3. Onboard schools (grade 8-12) to use our software to educate students. (can move on to Uni onboarding once this is tackled iA)
4. Create a trading bot that gives automated high turn out rate signals on discord/slack/telegram etc. for all types of trading (stocks, forex, crypto, ETFs etc.), all on separate channels. We can test the trading bots’ signals on our own demo accounts for a bit, track the success rate, and then put it on the market when we’re certain that it’s profitable and can also show proof of its success through data.
5. Onboard trading mentors to freelance on the platform
6. Create a platform for traders where they can custom make stock trading algorithms with user-friendly drag and drop UI, for a more affordable price than most companies right now. The trading bots will be targeted to day traders, not the big players. We want to democratize wealth through this product (either one time cost to create one algorithm OR bundle of multiple algorithms for cheaper than getting them solo OR monthly membership of some sort).

We nurture the next-gen of knowledgable traders, the financially-independent of the future.
