# Y Trade
Y Trade is a gamified learning platform for youth interested in trading. 

Users will complete a short survey which will rank them on one of three learning streams: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. The three learning streams will have different content for learning pathways, respective to the specific streams. 

The app will have the following learning modules: 
1. Stock market/stock trading knowledge (reading charts, S/L + T/P, etc.)
2. Crypto/Blockchain
3. Financial knowledge for stock trading (risk management and more) 
4. Trading mindset (trader tips which ensure most gains and least losses)
5. Mentorship from stock traders. 
6. .# ADD MORE MODULES WHEN THEY COME TO MIND 

Users accumulate points through progressing on learning paths on the app, which can be put towards in-app purchases.

We nurture the next-gen of knowledgable traders, the financially-independent of the future.
